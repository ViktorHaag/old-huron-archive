title: "Factions in Traveller"
description: "Borrowing bits and pieces from other table-top roleplaying games
for use with _Traveller_ seems like a good way to fill out places where it has a
few gaps; but I try to do this with care, mindful that the spareness of the
original rules-set is more often a feature than it is a defect. Still, while
_Traveller_ provides an excellent framework for describing people, space-ships,
worlds and star-systems, and creatures, one place where it stumbles a bit is on
the _social_ side of things. While it does contain a workmanlike “reaction table”
and some assistance in building “patrons” and encounters, it doesn’t really give
much guidance on ways to build and represent groups of people and their common
interests. Enter the “Circles” rules from the _M-Space_ game: a clean and simple
way to define factions, of various sizes and kinds."

[M-Space](https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/210934/m-space) provides a formal way to
describe "circles", or groups of people of various sizes and reaches, organized
together for one reason or another, sharing common goals or beliefs (see MS
p156). This strikes me as exactly the kind of elegant subsystem that can be
quickly and easily ported into _Classic Traveller_ for practical use. I think the
word "factions" describes better to me what these things are, so I'm going to
call them that in my use of them.

I'm building out the notion of factions by first starting with the idea of porting it into Traveller, then building some example factions for use in my game, and then refining the scales and mechanics involved in using them over time. Accordingly, I'll follow up with another more house-rules type post in the future that delves further into how rules for factions can work. In this post, I'll start the ball rolling with a summary description of them, and some examples.

## Describing factions

As in _M-Space_ circles, factions get described with a light set of mechanics.
See the nearby sidebar for the general table format used to present a faction's
description.

::: {.column-margin}
```{=html}
<table>
  <thead style="border-top: 1px solid; border-bottom: 1px solid;">
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2"> Faction name </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="border-top: 1px dotted; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <td colspan="2">
        Descriptive paragraph for the faction; should include both simple
        capsule summary of the faction's identity, as well as some identifying
        traits by which one could recognize membership.

    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <td>
        <b>Ideas</b>
      </td>
      <td>
        List of <i>Ideas</i> for faction

    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <td> <b>UFP</b> </td>
      <td>
        Characteristics in hex form:<br>
        - Influence<br>
        - Size<br>
        - Resources
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <td> <b>Attributes</b> </td>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

**Type and Descriptor**. Every faction belongs to one of five types: Organization,
Ideology, Corporation, Location, Polity. When writing down the type of a
faction, you also use a descriptor that further characterizes it: for example,
"Organization (Charitable)" or "Corporation (Mining Conglomerate)".

**Ideas**. Factions are united by motivations, ideals, beliefs, or ideas commonly
held by their membership. Some factions will only have one idea, some will have
a few. Some will have a public facing idea, and a secret idea, perhaps known
only to an inner-circle of membership. I'm taking the list of ideas pretty much
straight from _M-Space_ (p166).

**Characteristics**. Every faction has three characteristics given numeric ratings,
just as with characters and worlds in Traveller: Influence, Size, and Resources.
We'll use the same rough valuation scale for these characteristics: ranging from
0 on up to 15 or more, employing the same modified hexadecimal notation as for
characters and worlds -- we can arrange these characteristics into a "Universal
Faction Profile" string (or UFP).

**Attributes**. As characters in _Traveller_ have skills, factions have
attributes. Each attribute for a faction has an associated level just as with
characters' skills. The level gives a rough indication of the strength of that
attribute and could be used as a die modifier for throws involving the faction.
I'm taking the list of likely attributes from _M-Space_ (p160-1), but I suspect
I'll be adding a few here and there (for example, it seems like there should be
one for Research, so I'm using that in one of my examples that follows).

**Rank**. Characters can have ranks within a faction, using the same scale as
employed with ranks during character generation (0 through 6). I don't use this
in my examples here, but I envision that this concept can get used to help rules
on factions dovetail with the _Traveller_ character generation and description
mechanics.

## Hounslow examples

Here's some examples of factions prepared for my regular _Traveller_ adventures
set in the Barbican Subsector, currently on the world of Hounslow.

**Business concerns**. Because the characters in my current adventures are
direct representatives of a Commonwealth merchant prince company (Vargas SL),
let's start with a handful of corporate factions, beginning with a feature of
the adventures currently, Engstrom Ltd; the main thrust of the group's current
adventures pits their merchant patron in tension with Engstrom.

```{=html}
<table>
  <thead style="border-top: 1px solid; border-bottom: 1px solid;">
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Engstrom Ltd</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="border-top: 1px dotted; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <td colspan="2">
        Merchant house native to Hounslow with significant power and influence,
        with interests primarily in industrial manufacturing and
        pharmaceuticals. Have long held control over a significant bloc of
        interest in the Hounslow council, are by nature conservative, but see
        further development of relations with the Commonwealth as inevitable and
        therefore seek to remain as central to this development as possible so
        it can be shaped as much as possible to their benefit.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <th><b>Ideas</b></th>
      <td>Tradition, Power, Wealth</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

To counter-balance Engstrom, we need a business that's their obverse; Becontree
roots rather than Hounslow, different area of business focus, different
ideological stance, and so on.

```{=html}
<table>
  <thead style="border-top: 1px solid; border-bottom: 1px solid;">
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Beinhoff Ferguson Plc</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="border-top: 1px dotted; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <td colspan="2">
        Agribusiness concern native to Becontree with growing influence in
        Hounslow's corridors of power, BFP's roots are as a settler cooperative
        placed in some of Becontree's most arable and productive regions. While
        historically primarily a producer of grains and grasses, BFP has over
        the past century grown, diversified, and invested heavily in marine
        agriculture; to the point where a good third of their business is now
        directly tied to the farming of marine plant and animal life.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <th><b>Ideas</b></th>
      <td>Innovation, Environment, Wealth</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <th><b>UFP</b></th>

    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">

      <td>
        Connected-2, Legal-1, Politics-1, Research-2, Territory-3
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Let's also throw in a third business concern for more balance; the two already
presented can sort of stand in for the worlds of Hounslow and Becontree, so
let's have another that can represent the main source of raw-material wealth at
Hounslow's disposal -- it's mineral rich asteroid belt.

```{=html}

  <thead style="border-top: 1px solid; border-bottom: 1px solid;">
    <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Kaspar Independent Mining</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="border-top: 1px dotted; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <td colspan="2">
        Mining cooperative native to Hounslow's belt, KIM is a massive
        conglomeration of independent owner-operators and small-family run
        mining concerns in the belt, united to provide political clout and
        influence within Honslow's Council. KIM is characterized by internal
        squabbles and disagreements and are somewhat notorious for rarely
        settling on any truly united position; their policies are often formed
        more in resistance to Hounslow's established commercial families than in
        any kind of united front of their own.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <th><b>Ideas</b></th>
      <td>Independence, Group, Wealth</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">

        Spread-2, Territory-2
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

**Political concerns**. We also need some factions that aren't
business-oriented, and some that represent the Commonwealth's footprint out on
the frontier. Here are some factions for that; first, the Emerald Path.

```{=html}
<table>
  <thead style="border-top: 1px solid; border-bottom: 1px solid;">
    <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Emerald Path</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="border-top: 1px dotted; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <td colspan="2">
        Secretive, decentralized resistance movement dedicated to the cause of
        liberating Becontree from what's promulgated as Hounslow's colonial
        influence; as a result, the Path is not warmly predisposed towards the
        Commonwealth either. They have no intention of replacing one colonizer's
        boot with another. Overtly employing peaceful measures to achieve their
        aims, they nonetheless have several cells less concerned with the
        niceties of non-violence. Somewhat in contrast to their public persona,
        the Path is also remarkably well-funded.

Hounslow Station is the primary gateway for in-system and inter-system travel at
Hounslow; it's run by an independent Station Authority given direct remit by the
Hounslow Council with the business of managing the Station.

```{=html}
<table>
  <thead style="border-top: 1px solid; border-bottom: 1px solid;">
    <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Hounslow Station Authority</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="border-top: 1px dotted; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <td colspan="2">
        The Station Authority runs all space-station facilities in the Hounslow
        system, consisting of one primary and several subsidiary stations. There
        exist also many private docking facilities within the Hounslow asteroid
        belt, but they all fall under the control of private mining interests,
        or conglomerates like KIM. In many ways, the Station Authority is more
        efficient government for the Station and its facilities than Hounslow's
        own Council is for life planet-side.

    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">

Finally, the primary Commonwealth presence in Hounslow is the Scout service who
have a base in-system; their primary rivals are the Commonwealth Navy, and not
anyone local, although they do meet with some tension in interacting with local
factions.

```{=html}
<table>
  <thead style="border-top: 1px solid; border-bottom: 1px solid;">
    <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Scout Service (Hounslow Base)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="border-top: 1px dotted; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 0.5px dotted;">
      <td colspan="2">
        The Scout service is a massive arm of the Commonwealth government, and
        they have an official presence within the Hounslow system. Much of the
        infrastructure within the Hounslow Station Authority's control was
        directly funded by, and requried by, the Scout service who pay the
        Authority significant fees on an annual basis for privileged use of the
        facilities. Nominally here to explore and chart the frontier extents of
        the Commonwealth, the Scout service's representative bureaucracy here is
        not above involving themselves in commerce and graft.
