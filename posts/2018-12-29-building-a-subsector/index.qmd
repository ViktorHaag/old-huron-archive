title: "Building out a subsector"
description: "Travellers need a place to start travelling, so the first real
steps of prepration for ar eferee involve building out a subsector. Starting
with the stellar data from the *Near Space* book published by Stellagama
Publishing for the *Traveller* quadrant around our own Sol system, I picked
one of the fourt subsector-sized quarters of the map and took to fleshing it out."

I wanted the playing field for the players to suggest a set of world names that
seemed similar, somehow familiar, perhaps a bit old-timey, not just lifted from
some existing SF media property, and decidedly not fanciful or made-up.
Accordingly, I hit upon the plan that each subsector of stars would feature
world names directly cribbed from the subway map of one of Earth's [Global
cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city/). The system names become
less important than the world names -- in some cases, the world name might be
the familiar name for the system's most populated world, in others, its largest
space-station.

The first subsector built would use names from the London tube map, thus
*Barbican subsector* (where Barbican is the name of the world located in the
system around Barnard's Star, and the primary world for the subsector -- primary
worlds for each subsector are those with the best startport, closest to Sol;
Earth is the primary world in the subsector containing Sol). Subsectors built
later will use names taken from the subway systems of other global cities, not
yet decided (most likely, Paris, Tokyo, and Beijing). The particular
configuration of the world names make very little sense with respect to the
cities from which they're drawn; in general the world names just happen to
mostly start with the same letters as part of the system names for which they
stand.

**Data methods**. I used the tables from Book 3, adjusted slightly for some
simple house rules. In order to generate a nice map, I'm using the excellent
online [Traveller Map](https://travellermap.com/) resource (if you use the
"poster maker" tool there, it lets you enter your own custom data). The only
tricky bit is it has specific expectations about the format, including some bits
and generated data that's not part of the old Book 3 system. Accordingly, I
massaged some of the stellar codes from Stellagama's [*Near
Space*](https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/211119/near-space) book because the Map site
didn't like some of them, and I fudged the trade codes (which I suspect are
derived from guidelines found in later versions of the game that are slightly
different). In the end, though, I got a nice map included here.

For the known jump routes, I used the chances from the table in the 1977 version
of Book 3, and not the "communication routes" guidelines from the 1981 rules. I
also decided to hand-place a set of routes that are not known commercially, but
are "service routes" known as classified information to the Scout and Navy
services -- this helps to string the subsector together a bit more, projecting
known jump routes from naval and scout bases that seem to make some sense, and
might prove tasty secrets for player characters to seek out.

## Barbican subsector

The subsector just rimward and coreward of Sol is named Barbican subsector. It
has four worlds with class-A starports, and two class-B, mostly located to the
trailing and rimward side of the sub-sector.

At this stage, I don't want to think too much about the details of the map; I'd
like to let things stew a little bit. Still, some features seem obvious.

**travel patterns**. A major travel corridor obviously exists ranging from
Hammersmith to Edgware and then round a horn to Willesden. As well, all the
high-value starports are hubs for commercial traffic. This makes sense given the
string of worlds that are only a single jump away from one another along the
right edge of the map, and the tweaks I used to make the worlds towards the
bottom right corner of the map more likely to have better starports; Sol is just
off the bottom-right corner of the map, a single parsec away from Hammersmith.

Away from the class A starports and the bottom right corner of the map, the ease
of travel drops off precipitously. Beyond Willesden and Gunnersbury, only the
Scout service has reliable jump data. Only the navy knows about a quick way to
get to Wanstead. Any routes not already known must be calculated and programmed
at jump time, and the compute resources required for this are prohibitive to
most.

**restricted access worlds**. Victoria, Becontree, and Willesden all start with
explicit "captive government" power structures (Government rating 6). This leads
to questions about who's running the show there. The Terran Commonwealth is the
overall authority in the quadrant, and they likely don't formally recognize any
rival multi-world governing structure: that said, like confederation or
commonwealth, Earth likely formally recognizes that individual worlds might have
sway over perhaps a pair or even three systems; and pragmatically speaking,
Commonwealth projection is likely to be (intentionally) limited to the core
systems that are nearer to Sol (those within immediate reach of Jump-4 ships).

*Victoria* seems like a great place to put a penal colony; it's likely that
government ships from Whitechapel jump directly to Wanstead, and then to
Victoria. It may make sense to include another route known only to the Navy
between Wanstead and Victoria, or it may instead make sense to demand that
prisoner transport there be capable of the dynamic jump-2 calculation on their
own.

*Becontree*, given the population at Hounslow, and the known route to Hounslow,
it seems like Becontree may well be a vassal state. Becontree may well be the
bread-basket for Hounslow, given it's agricultural status, and Hounslow's
distinctly non-agricultural status. Perhaps Becontree is a world filled with
subsidized agri-business (at best) or plantations (at worst).

*Willesden* has a scout base, and is a vital linchpin connecting the
well-travelled bottom right of the map with the top left where, mostly, only
scouts know how to proceed. It makes sense that access to Willesden may well be
strictly controlled by the Commonwealth Scout service and largely interdicted to
civilian traffic. Gant's position between the Scout-controlled Willesden and
Edgware, and its high law-level would seem to make it the foreward checkpoint
for Willesden.

## Looking ahead

In the spirit of not preparing too far ahead of the players, I'd like to avoid
explicit thinking too much further beyond this preparation point. What kinds of
characters the players create and where in particular they'd like to start play
should drive further diving into detail. One further step I might take is to
gather the rest of the "trade code" data gathered from the *Traveller Map* site
process (much richer and more varied than the LBB data), and perhaps spin that
out into simple "tags" for the worlds in the sub-sectors, similar to the notion
of "tagging" that comes from Sine Nomine's [*Stars Without
Number*](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/8524/stars-without-number) SF game, but I don't
want to overburden the game with too much in the way of hybrid house rules,
until I at least get a good set of adventures off the ground using pretty much
as pure *Traveller* as I can.

A party that wants to stick closer to civilization and get involved in
adventures that range less on the frontier will probably want to stick close to
the Hammersmith-Edgware corridor of easy jumps and fat starports. Remote
clusters of adventure could centre in the cluster of worlds around Gloucester or
Hounslow. Morden is a mostly livable, low-population, but moderate tech-level
world that's a jump-2 from the rest of civilization, so explaining why they've
been cut off and getting them back in contact, could provide for a set of
focused adventures that might be rather un-*Traveller* like, but nevertheless
interesting.

We'll see what the players want to do.
