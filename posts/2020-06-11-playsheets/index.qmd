title: "Using Playsheets"
description: "Several years back, I took to the practice of running RPG sessions
using what I call playsheets; one-page (front and back) easily readable summary
sheets that give me vital PC reference information and status about the current
situation at a glance. These have been very useful especially when running
sessions not from pre-published adventures, but more improvisationally."

I certainly can't claim to have invented them; gaming companies have, for
decades, produced "adventure logs" and "combat sheets" and all manner of forms
that individual referees might or might not find useful at their own tables. I
never particularly did, maybe because their form never really suited my
functional needs -- they didn't have enough space for the stuff I needed, or
spent too much space on things I had no real use for.

But, at some point, I was trying to teach myself how do things with Apple's
_Pages_ application, and decided that what I really needed for the game I was
currently running was a summary one-pager I could refer to during my game
sessions. A one-pager that had the vital character details on it, and some
sketchy session notes about what was going on.

As I continued this practice I found that while I did make use of the playsheet
(often, for example, using it as a place to scrawl notes, keep track of
opponent's health during combats, and so on) what was more useful to me,
actually, was the prep process of _filling it out_ ahead of time. Just the
exercise of committing to typing out enough information to fill out the
playsheet helped me prepare for my sessions. It didn't matter if the actual play
covered only a portion of what was written on the playsheet, or went in
unexpected directions -- that was all fine. But the exercise of writing the
notes down on paper helped crystallize in my head where we currently were at,
and where things could likely head (and what I planned to do if they did).

the entire Traveller character fits on the sheet neatly (with other games, not
so much).](playsheet-front.png)

I also found that the _scale_ of the playsheet was useful -- keeping it to a
one-pager often helped me be concise and economical; I found that the single
sheet seemed to fit the general length of a play-session for me. I didn't need
to prepare more than that, but if the sheet looked bare, then it was a warning
that I might not really have enough going on to make the session rewarding.
Sometimes the same sheet got used session over session if we were in the middle
of working out some parts of the adventure; sometimes as we moved from one act
to another or one story-line to another, the whole sheet got revised.

The playsheet images here are for the first sheet created for my new ongoing
_Traveller_ adventures. It's got perhaps more detail on it, especially on the
back, than I might normally have.

You might try the same exercise if you like. There's little point in giving you
a template or something to download -- the playsheet is a really simple thing:

- Landscape layout, not portrait

- Character details table spanning two columns, taking up the "top half" of the
  playsheet front side

- Two column layout for the rest of the sheet to sketch out: where things are
  at, encounters or problems lying just ahead, and details for characters or
  creatures or opponents that the players might meet and interact with

Very simple; very effective.
