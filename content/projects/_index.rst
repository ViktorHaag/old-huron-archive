Traveller
---------

I'm developing a set of resources for ongoing games using the old, Classic
Traveller [CT]_ set of rolegame rules.

   **terran commonwealth**. My current ongoing games use a `setting of my own
   divising </projects/traveller/commonwealth/>`_, rather than the traditional
   Imperium setting associated with the Traveller game. My goals for the
   setting were to keep things much more constrained and "closer to home"
   (nearer to Earth in space and time) for players and myself.

   Part of building the setting up involves developing an `ongoing set of house
   rules </projects/traveller/house_rules>`_.
