.. sidebar:: ongoing projects

   This section lists material being worked on, organized not as a series of
   blog posts but in a more traditional web-site manner. The pages here are
   nearly all works in progress.

Traveller
---------

I'm developing a set of resources for ongoing games using the old, |ct| [CT]_
set of rolegame rules.

   **terran commonwealth**. My current ongoing games use a `setting of my own
   divising </projects/traveller/commonwealth/>`_, rather than the traditional
   Imperium setting associated with the Traveller game. My goals for the
   setting were to keep things much more constrained and "closer to home"
   (nearer to Earth in space and time) for players and myself.

   Part of building the setting up involves developing an `ongoing set of house
   rules </projects/traveller/house_rules>`_.


RuneQuest
---------

With the new edition of |rq| [RQ]_, I've decided to turn back to trying gaming
set in Glorantha.

   **new players**. As my players are liable to know next to nothing about it,
   to start with, I'm going to make every effort to use a limited number of
   books as authorities on anything, and focus strongly on adventures and
   progressive release of setting detail only when it becomes important in
   play.

   That said, it's a rich enough setting that it probably requires at least
   `a player introduction booklet </projects/runequest/intro>`_ of some kind.
