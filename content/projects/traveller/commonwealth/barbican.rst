   Barbican subsector details showing UWP and Jump route paths.
   
   | Solid lines: known commercial jump routes
   | Dashed lines: classified, naval jump routes
   | Dotted lines: classified, scout jump routes

**travel patterns**. A major travel corridor exists ranging from
Hammersmith to Edgware and then round a horn to Willesden. As well, all the
high-value starports are hubs for commercial traffic. This makes sense given
the string of worlds that are only a single jump away from one another along
the right edge of the map, and the tweaks I used to make the worlds towards the
bottom right corner of the map more likely to have better starports; Sol is
just off the bottom-right corner of the map, a single parsec away from
Hammersmith.

Away from the class A starports and the bottom right corner of the map, the
ease of travel drops off precipitously. Beyond Willesden and Gunnersbury, only
the Scout service has reliable jump data. Only the navy knows about a quick way
to get to Wanstead. Any routes not already known must be calculated and
programmed at jump time, and the compute resources required for this are
prohibitive to most.

**restricted access worlds**. Victoria, Becontree, and Willesden all start with
explicit "captive government" power structures (Government rating `6`). This
leads to questions about who's running the show there. The Terran Commonwealth
is the overall authority in the quadrant, and they likely don't formally
recognize any rival multi-world governing structure: that said, like
confederation or commonwealth, Earth likely formally recognizes that individual
worlds might have sway over perhaps a pair or even three systems; and
pragmatically speaking, Commonwealth projection is likely to be (intentionally)
limited to the core systems that are nearer to Sol (those within immediate
reach of Jump-4 ships).

*Victoria* seems like a great place to put a penal colony; it's likely that
government ships from Whitechapel jump directly to Wanstead, and then to
Victoria. It may make sense to include another route known only to the Navy
between Wanstead and Victoria, or it may instead make sense to demand that
prisoner transport there be capable of the dynamic jump-2 calculation on their
own.

*Becontree*, given the population at Hounslow, and the known route to Hounslow,
it seems like Becontree may well be a vassal state. Becontree may well be the
bread-basket for Hounslow, given it's agricultural status, and Hounslow's
distinctly non-agricultural status. Perhaps Becontree is a world filled with
subsidized agri-business (at best) or plantations (at worst).

*Willesden* has a scout base, and is a vital linchpin connecting the
well-travelled bottom right of the map with the top left where, mostly, only
scouts know how to proceed. It makes sense that access to Willesden may well be
strictly controlled by the Commonwealth Scout service and largely interdicted
to civilian traffic. Gant's position between the Scout-controlled Willesden and
Edgware, and its high law-level would seem to make it the foreward checkpoint
for Willesden.


Edgware
=======
What we know about Edgware so far:

.. code::

   Edgware    B000355/B    Sb, Ni, Gg, Ab

This brief line of stats tells us some interesting stuff, just like knowing the
RPG stats for a character can lead us to form a simple picture of what the
character is like. Here's how I described the numbers for my players:

     **Features**. The system has a Scout Base, one or more Gas Giants, and an
     Asteroid Belt. Its population is a bit too low for it to be an industrial
     system, but it's on the verge of industry.

     It has a 'B' class star base, so refined fuel *is* available. The Scout
     base means Scout ships get fuelled by the Scout Service, and the base
     means that Scouts can have access to service data (i.e. navigation and
     such).

     It has no habitable world in-system; the starport is either in a station
     orbiting one of the planets or built into an astroid within/on the edge of
     its astroid belt.

     Its population is order of magnitude thousands of people.

     The law level of 5 means that personal, concealable firearms are
     prohibited. Knives of a modest size are permitted, and shotguns are
     permitted with permits and within certain areas.

     The local government is headed by a Governer, separate from the Scout
     Service personnel (who have their own bureaucracy), who runs the system
     rather like one might find on a commercial industrial platform or large
     ship -- governance is divided up into departments that are nominally in
     charge of various technical tasks, and each of those departments has their
     own reporting structure that all report up into the governor.

Where can we go from here? I decided on two approaches:

- I'd like to use the some of the extended material in *Book 6: Scouts* and the
  *Near Space* [NS]_ original stellar data on the system to bring a bit more
  physical detail to what's really there in the system -- how many gas giants
  are there? Where are they? Are there other planets there? How many stars are
  there? (And perhaps most importantly) what are the general *travel times*
  between the features in the system (i.e. distance from starport to jump
  point, distance from starport to gas giants, and so on). These facts might
  not help players choose narrative paths, but they will help bring the system
  alive and act as a backdrop of "known information" to answer simple questions
  (like "how long do we have to fly in system before we can jump?")

- I'd like to use some of the *encounter* materials from the basic books (or
  the Starter Traveller versions of them) to flesh out some rumours, patrons,
  and the like to give the world *wider playable texture*. These resources will
  help me support the pushing the first adventure forward and let the players
  make some choices about what they investigate and follow up on.

The rest of this post will deal with the first of these approaches; I'll leave
the second approach for a subsequent post.


Edgware's wider system
----------------------
Traveller's basic book gives you a way to generate simple data for "the main
world" in a system, whatever that main world presence might be: it could be a
planet (like Earth), a space-station, a base on a moon surrounding a gas giant,
and so forth. Traveller explicitly leaves that up to the referee to
decide. *Book 6: Scouts* gives you a system for helping to further determine
detail for a star system beyond just the main world.

The *Near Space* [NS]_ book provides more information for the system that
contains my Edgware:

* The real-world star system for Edgware is Eggen 372, a single-star system
  with a real-world spectral type of `WD` (*Near Space* uses the code `WD` to
  cover all the white dwarf sub-classifications; in reality, I believe that
  Eggen 372's currently understood
  `real-world spectral class <http://www.stellar-database.com/scripts/search_star.exe?ID=124100>`_ is `DXP9`.)

* The system has one asteroid belt, and one gas giant.

* The main world's temperature range is "Cold", which isn't at all surprising
  given its star.
  
**Star type**. The *Scouts* book does not provide good info for how to use
`DXP9` spectral types (partly because it seems to me that the `DX` designation
means "we can't really tell what the spectral type classification for this star
should be"), however, if we look at the ISDB indication for its visual
luminosity and its apparent diameter, the closest match seems to peg its
spectral class at `DG` as most similar on that basis.

**Orbital features**. A `DG` type star is too feeble to have a habitable zone,
according to the *Scouts* book. According to the table of zones, a `DG` type
star has five orbital zones available, all "outer". First we place the gas giant
and belt in the available zones, and determine that none of the other available
orbits are empty. Then we generate basic planet attributes for the additional
planets in the system, including how many satellites they may have.

One interesting thing to fall out of this process is to note that the Eggen
372/II (the second planet in the system) has two moons, and also has a
population of `2` (or, order hundreds). It may be that there's an outpost
further in-system from the asteroid belt that has the main "world" (dubbed
"Edgware station") -- why it's there is for further thought.

Grabbing some names from around Edgware tube station using Google Maps gives us
some names to slap on planets in the Edgware system.

We can dive down another level of detail and figure out if there's anything on
any of those moons that's meaningful by generating UPP stats for them, too. I
won't bother at this point except to arbitrarily put a "station" of some sort
on the third moon of Hale (the gas giant), with population of `1` (order tens).

**Travel times**. One aspect of this system detail is knowing how long it takes
to travel from one place in-system to another. The planetary orbits have radius
lengths, so roughly speaking, the travel time between two orbits would range
from that value, up to twice the value, depending on where in-orbit the start
and end point of a trip are actually relative to one another (in actual fact,
because orbits aren't always circular or arranged on a flat plane, it's
probably more complicated than that, but I only want to know in rough terms
what the travel times are between features). For Edgeware's system then:

* Travel from Edgware Station to either Hale, the gas giant, or the outpost on
  Rectory is a trip of about 70 million km on average; at 1G that's "about two
  days", and at 2G that's "about a day and a half".

* Travel between Rectory and Hale is a trip of about 135 million km on average;
  at 1G that's "about two and three-quarter days", and at 2G that's "about two
  days".

* Travel from Edgware Station to a jump point is likely pretty fast since the
  gravity disturbance from the asteroid field is minimal; let's say the safe
  jump distance from Edgware is about 80,000 km (about half the distance that's
  a safe jump distance from a size 1 world); at 1G that's "about an hour and a
  half", and at 2G that's "about an hour".

  Travel from Rectory to a jump point is about 320,000 km; at 1G that's "just
  over three hours", and at 2G that's "about two and a quarter hours".

  Travel from Hale to a jump point is *long*. We can estimate that Hale (as a
  large gas giant) has a diameter that's about 230,000 km [GG]_, and a safe jump
  distance is 100 diameters, or 23 million km; at 1G that's a trip of "just
  over a day", and at 2G that's "about three-quarters of a day".

**Scout base**. The question of where to put the Scout base is interesting; is
it co-located with the main world at Edgware, in the belt? Or is it elsewhere
in-system. I like the idea that it's co-located, providing for cooperation but
also cheek-by-jowl tension with the local authority. Thus, the population on
Rectory and Hale station are for some reason other than the scout base:
listening posts, small scientific research stations, and so forth.

At this point, I think we have all the physical detail for the system that we
need. Now we have a better idea of what the system looks like, and how the
local lay of the land might look, and we can use that information to help seed
some tables for encounters (rumours and patrons, and so on).


Oval

The world of Oval is an insular place, within a trinary star-system (36
Ophiuchi, blessed (or cursed?) with a high population and a highly restrictive
local authority.

**Star types**. The system primary star's type is K2V, the captive star types
are K1V and K5V:


**Orbital features**. The Oval system's orbital features are complex.

*Primus*. The primary star has several asteroid belts, a relatively close

The only habitable zone in the entire system has the system's only
planet, containing the Oval starport (such as it is) and main settlement
population (of several billion people).

*Travel times*. Travel times within the Oval system, all judged to or from
Oval:

- The outer belt at 1G (about three days) and at 2G (just over two days)

- Brixton at 1G (about four days) and at 2G (about three days)

- Near jump point at 1G (about six and a half hours) and at 2G (about 4 and a
  half hours)

As the gas giant has a beacon station and refuelling point, here are useful
travel times for it:

- The outer belt at 1G (about three and three-quarter days) and at 2G (about
  two days)

- Jump point  at 1G (just over a day) and at 2G (about three-quarters of a
  day).
