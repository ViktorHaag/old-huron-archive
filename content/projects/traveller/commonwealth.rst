When I turned to wanting to pick up _Traveller_ again, I decided that I wanted
to bake my own, much smaller setting for the game than the default Imperium
setting that came to dominate canonical _Traveller_ lore as time passed in its
lifespan. I have [written a post](/2018/12/building-a-new-traveller-setting/)
that goes more in depth about why I did this, and how I approached things, so I
won't go into detail about that here.

The Commonwealth is a relatively small, jump-drive capable polity
centred around Sol including four sub-sectors of known and settled worlds. It's
generally at a slightly lower tech-level than the traditional *Traveller*
setting, not stretching much beyond the ship designs and equipment portrayed in
the first three *Classic Traveller* [CT]_ rulebooks.

Territory
---------
The Commonwealth stretches out from Sol to occupy four Traveller subsectors
worth of settled worlds. The polity is in a phase of re-expansion after a
recent falling back during a dim age that lasted several hundred
years. Accordingly, the worlds on the far edges of the Commonwealth may have
colonists on them, but are also not so much under the grip of central
authority.

*Barbican*. The `subsector coreward and spinward
</projects/traveller/commonwealth/barbican>`_ from Sol. It has two
significant features: a closely packed straight line of worlds extending in
jump one distances from Sol, thus making a busy trade corridor; and, a cluster
of worlds on the far edge of the Commonwealth with a significant population but
a tenuously mapped connection to the central authority (the only rutters
currently available to get there are carefully controlled by the Scout
Service).

*Concorde*. The subsector coreward and trailing from Sol.
