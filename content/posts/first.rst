Getting back into blogging
==========================

For years, I belonged to a loose collection of gaming-related people on
Google+, and then in their wisdom, Google decided to shutter the service and a
diaspora of gaming folks occurred. I took the opportunity to try doing what a
bunch of the other folk were doing -- warming up a blog.

Apart from anything else, this also gives me the opportunity to play a bit with
static site generation tools and hosting.

I fully expect that the balance of content here is going to be game related,
and mostly related to tabletop role playing games and board games. If these
things interest you, you're welcome to follow along. If not, I'm sure that
there's plenty of other stuff on the internet you can find more aligned to your
interests.
