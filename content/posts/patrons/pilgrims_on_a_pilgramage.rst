   **Noble**, **Pilgrim**; **Required Skills**: Steward; **Required Equipment**: ship (yacht preferred)

**Player information**. Two high-ranking officiants of the Ninefold Path are
seeking passage to a nearby world for an upcoming conclave. Each has an
accompanying retinue of a few postulants acting as servants for them during the
trip. Because they do not want to be disturbed during their voyage, they are
interested in chartering the players' ship for the voyage.

The functionary sent to negotiate and finalize the business arrangements will
not be among the party travelling. While officially she assures players that
the needs of the officiants will be minimal, and their manner humble, if the
players take care to forge a good connection with her and dig a bit deeper, it
will become clear that both officiants are highly placed, and well used to
having underlings do their bidding without question. They will expect high
passage treatment on the journey, and the better experienced the Steward that
takes care of their needs, the better.

**Referee information**. Pick, or roll, for what might be going on.

*1-3*. All is as represented. No surprises occur. The group of adherents is
internally harmonious, and while they might expect detailed and deferential
service, if the players can provide this, all will be fine.

*4-5*. The Ninefold Path is a church naturally divided into two principal
sects, and delight in extended debate upon finer points of doctrine. The two
officiants in the party in question are particular rivals with one another, and
the trip may have especially heated moments where the players will have to
attempt to soothe and calm the waters, or be held responsible for an
unsatisfactory voyage.

*6*. Same as above, except if the players do not step in, matters will get well
out of hand, and one of hte postulants will end up dead. Players will need to
take steps to, firstly, prove that the murder wasn't done by a member of the
crew (as the officiants will first insist), and secondly, will need to
determine to the officiants satisfaction exactly who is responsible.

The investigation should depend on things like: building up a logical record of
testimony by the passengers to determine that someone is obviously lying,
perhaps backed up physical forensic evidence that could be gathered and
analyzed by the ship's medic or by poring through the ship's computer records
for passenger movements (in which case, delicately presenting this evidence to
the officiants may be needed), etc.
