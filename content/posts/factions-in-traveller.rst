Borrowing bits and pieces from other table-top roleplaying games for use with
*Traveller* seems like a good way to fill out places where it has a few gaps;
but I try to do this with care, mindful that the spareness of the original
rules-set is more often a feature than it is a defect. Still, while *Traveller*
provides an excellent framework for describing people, space-ships, worlds and
star-systems, and creatures, one place where it stumbles a bit is on the
*social* side of things. While it does contain a workmanlike "reaction table"
and some assistance in building "patrons" and encounters, it doesn't really give
much guidance on ways to build and represent groups of people and their common
interests. Enter the "Circles" rules from the *M-Space* game: a clean and simple
way to define factions, of various sizes and kinds.

*M-Space* [MS]_ provides a formal way to describe "circles", or groups of people
of various sizes and reaches, organized together for one reason or another,
sharing common goals or beliefs (see MS p156). This strikes me as exactly the
kind of elegant subsystem that can be quickly and easily ported into *Classic
Traveller* for practical use. I think the word "factions" describes better to me
what these things are, so I'm going to call them that in my use of them.

I'm building out the notion of factions by first starting with the idea of
porting it into *Traveller*, then building some example factions for use in my
game, and then refining the scales and mechanics involved in using them over
time. Accordingly, I'll follow up with another more house-rules type post in the
future that delves further into how rules for factions can work. In this post,
I'll start the ball rolling with a summary description of them, and some examples.

Describing factions
-------------------
As in *M-Space* circles, factions get described with a light set of mechanics.
See the nearby sidebar for the general table format used to present a faction's
description.

**Type and Descriptor**. Every faction belongs to one of five types: Organization,
Ideology, Corporation, Location, Polity. When writing down the type of a
faction, you also use a *descriptor* that further characterizes it: for example,
"Organization (Religious)" or "Corporation (Mining Conglomerate)".

**Ideas**. Factions are united by motivations, ideals, beliefs, or *ideas*
commonly held by their membership. Some factions will only have one idea, some will
have a few. Some will have a public facing idea, and a secret idea, perhaps
known only to an inner-circle of membership. I'm taking the list of ideas pretty
much straight from *M-Space* (see MS p166).

**Characteristics**. Every faction has three characteristics given numeric
ratings, just as with characters and worlds in *Traveller*: Influence, Size, and
Resources. We'll use the same rough valuation scale for these characteristics:
ranging from 0 on up to 15 or more, employing the same modified hexadecimal
notation as for characters and worlds -- we can arrange these characteristics
into a "Universal Faction Profile" string (or UFP).

**Attributes**. As characters in *Traveller* have skills, factions have
*attributes*. Each attribute for a faction has an associated level just as with
characters' skills. The level gives a rough indication of the strength of that
attribute and could be used as a die modifier for throws involving the faction.
I'm taking the list of likely attributes from *M-Space* (p160-1), but I suspect
I'll be adding a few here and there (for example, it seems like there should be
one for *Research*, so I'm using that in one of my examples that follows).

**Rank**. Characters can have *ranks* within a faction, using the same scale as
employed with ranks during character generation (0 through 6). I don't use this
in my examples here, but I envision that this concept can get used to help rules
on factions dovetail with the *Traveller* character generation and description
mechanics.


Hounslow examples
-----------------
Here's some examples of factions prepared for my regular *Traveller* adventures
set in the Barbican Subsector, currently on the world of Hounslow.

**Business concerns**. Because the characters in my current adventures are
direct representatives of a Commonwealth merchant prince company (Vargas SL),
let's start with a handful of corporate factions, beginning with a feature of
the adventures currently, Engstrom Ltd; the main thrust of the group's current
adventures pits their merchant patron in tension with Engstrom.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Engstrom Ltd                                                                |
+=============================================================================+
| Merchant house native to Hounslow with significant power and influence, with|
| interests primarily in industrial manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. Have   |
| long held control over a significant bloc of interest in the Hounslow       |
| council, are by nature conservative, but see further development of         |
| relations with the Commonwealth as inevitable and therefore seek to remain  |
| as central to this development as possible so it can be shaped as much as   |
| possible to their benefit.                                                  |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|   **Ideas**    | Tradition, Power, Wealth                                   |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|    **UFP**     | A56                                                        |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Attributes** | Connected-4, Legal-2, Media-1, Politics-2, Secrecy-1       |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

To counter-balance Engstrom, we need a business that's their obverse; Becontree
roots rather than Hounslow, different area of business focus, different
ideological stance, and so on.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Beinhoff Ferguson Plc                                                       |
+=============================================================================+
| Agribusiness concern native to Becontree with growing influence in          |
| Hounslow's corridors of power, BFP's roots are as a settler cooperative     |
| placed in some of Becontree's most arable and productive regions. While     |
| historically primarily a producer of grains and grasses, BFP has over the   |
| past century grown, diversified, and invested heavily in marine agriculture;|
| to the point where a good third of their business is now directly tied to   |
| the farming of marine plant and animal life.                                |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|   **Ideas**    | Innovation, Environment, Wealth                            |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|    **UFP**     | 84A                                                        |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Attributes** | Connected-2, Legal-1, Politics-1, Research-2, Territory-3  |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

Let's also throw in a third business concern for more balance; the two already
presented can sort of stand in for the worlds of Hounslow and Becontree, so
let's have another that can represent the main source of raw-material wealth
at Hounslow's disposal -- it's mineral rich asteroid belt.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Kasper Independent Mining                                                   |
+=============================================================================+
| Mining cooperative native to Hounslow's belt, KIM is a massive              |
| conglomeration of independent owner-operators and small-family run mining   |
| concerns in the belt, united to provide political clout and influence within|
| Honslow's Council. KIM is characterized by internal squabbles and           |
| disagreements and are somewhat notorious for rarely settling on any truly   |
| united position; their policies are often formed more in resistance to      |
| Hounslow's established commercial families than in any kind of united front |
| of their own.                                                               |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|   **Ideas**    | Independence, Group, Wealth                                |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|    **UFP**     | 5A5                                                        |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Attributes** | Dedicated Members-2, Cultural Heritage-1, Memes-1,         |
|                | Politics-1, Spread-2, Territory-2                          |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

**Political concerns**. We also need some factions that aren't
business-oriented, and some that represent the Commonwealth's footprint out on
the frontier. Here are some factions for that; first, the Emerald Path.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Emerald Path                                                                |
+=============================================================================+
| Secretive, decentralized resistance movement dedicated to the cause of      |
| liberating Becontree from what's promulgated as Hounslow's colonial         |
| influence; as a result, the Path is not warmly predisposed towards the      |
| Commonwealth either. They have no intention of replacing one colonizer's    |
| boot with another. Overtly employing peaceful measures to achieve their     |
| aims, they nonetheless have several cells less concerned with the niceties  |
| of non-violence. Somewhat in contrast to their public persona, the Path is  |
| also remarkably well-funded.                                                |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|   **Ideas**    | Independence, Anti-Colonialist, Group, Resistance          |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|    **UFP**     | 347                                                        |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Attributes** | Black Ops-2, Cellular-2, Dedicated Followers-2, Fear-2,    |
|                | Memes-3, Secrecy-3                                         |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

Hounslow Station is the primary gateway for in-system and inter-system travel at
Hounslow; it's run by an independent Station Authority given direct remit by the
Hounslow Council with the business of managing the Station.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Hounslow Station Authority                                                  |
+=============================================================================+
| The Station Authority runs all space-station facilities in the Hounslow     |
| system, consisting of one primary and several subsidiary stations. There    |
| exist also many private docking facilities within the Hounslow asteroid     |
| belt, but they all fall under the control of private mining interests, or   |
| conglomerates like KIM. In many ways, the Station Authority is more         |
| efficient government for the Station and its facilities than Hounslow's own |
| Council is for life planet-side.                                            |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|   **Ideas**    | Independence, Peace (Order)                                |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|    **UFP**     | 738                                                        |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Attributes** | Connected-2, Security-1, Territory-4                       |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

Finally, the primary Commonwealth presence in Hounslow is the Scout service who
have a base in-system; their primary rivals are the Commonwealth Navy, and not
anyone local, although they do meet with some tension in interacting with local
factions.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Scout Service (Hounslow Base)                                               |
+=============================================================================+
| The Scout service is a massive arm of the Commonwealth government, and they |
| have an official presence within the Hounslow system. Much of the           |
| infrastructure within the Hounslow Station Authority's control was directly |
| funded by, and requried by, the Scout service who pay the Authority         |
| significant fees on an annual basis for privileged use of the facilities.   |
| Nominally here to explore and chart the frontier extents of the             |
| Commonwealth, the Scout service's representative bureaucracy here is not    |
| above involving themselves in commerce and graft.                           |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|   **Ideas**    | Environment, Research, Pro-Commonwealth, Power             |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|    **UFP**     | 8BC                                                        |
+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Attributes** | Cultural Heritage-2, Info Retrieval-2, Politics-2,         |
|                | Research-4                                                 |
