The Distant Star serves as the flagship of Vargas SL, the patron merchant
corporation employing our heroes in my current Traveller adventures for one of
my weekly groups. I wanted to start with a standard 600T type-M Subsidized Liner
from the classic game, and heavily mod it as would sensibly be done by the
company for the use of one of their highly placed representatives on special
trade missions. This requires fiddling with the basic design in Book 2, chopping
away some of the suites, adding useful features not in the stock liner: a light
refactoring rather than a complete rebuild.

My current set of *Traveller* [CT]_ adventures provided a few needs that help
inform what kind of ship acts as the home ship for the characters. I knew that
the ship probably had to be jump-2 or jump-3 capable ship, because of where in
the sub-sector our adventures would start: right out on the frontier using
routes that needed at least jumps of this length to be feasible. I knew
that cargo space was useful, but not the most important thing for the ship; I
also knew that money was, in practical terms, not really a problem. The
mercantile concern acting as patrons for the characters had significant
resources, and the characters themselves would not be holding the paper on the
ship that would be ferrying them around -- rather, the characters would act as
members of their patron's personal retinue.

So, starting from these premises, I arrived at the notion that *The Distant
Star* would be one of the merchant family's flag ships in their merchant fleet.
The kind of vessel that would be both practical, and to some extent, impressive
and comfortable, and used for trade missions at the strategic level and not
necessary tactical level. Looking at the standard ship-build list in Book 2, I
thought, why not start with a Liner and strip out all the "luxury passengers"
tonnage, replacing it with more practical things that a highly-placed merchant
prince delegate might want? That gets me jump-3, and a fair amount of extra
space to play around with.

Starting with a stock 600 ton full, the Vargas SL company makes several
significant alterations for the custom flag ships in their fleet. Perhaps they
have three or four of these custom ship builds:

**Streamlining**. Adding streamlining to the basic design ensures the ships may
enter atmosphere and land on planet surfaces; additionally, the ships are fitted
with fuel scoops and equipment to take on board fuel from nearby bodies of
water.

**Fuel processing**. Vargas has managed to secure a small number of TL12 fuel
purification plants based on Commonwealth Naval design. The plants are
smaller than typically used in Commonwealth Naval ships, specifically designed
for ships in the 600 ton range and smaller. The fitting of these plants permit
it to process fuel for the ship, as well as the ship's launch. Processing a full
tank of unrefined fuel takes several hours. I borrowed the purification plant,
and the tonnage required, directly from Traveller Book 5 (High Guard) [HG2]_.

**Armaments**. As flagships, Vargas SL judges that they must be capable of
defending themselves. The Distant Star in particular is kitted with a single
turret sandcaster, and a double-turret hosting beam lasers (judging that accuracy
is more important to the ship's survival than impact).

**Improved manoeuvrability**. Sacrificing space typically set aside for passengers
in the 600-ton liner design lets Vargas dedicate space to improved engine
capacity. Still using the stock power plant and jump drives, this enhanced
flagship design boosts the manoeuvre drive fitted to allow for speeds in-system
of up to 3G without significant increase in fuel requirements.

**Reassignment of accommodation space**. All the space normally set aside for
passenger capacity is not needed in this modified design; the reclaimed space is
typically re-dedicated on these ships to 170 tons of cargo, additional ships
vehicles (a launch, ATV, and speeder), and a suite of emergency low berths in
case of unforeseen circumstances.

The final plan for the Distant Star thus looks like this:

=========================== ===========================
The Distant Star (Type M)   600 tons
=========================== ===========================
Manoeuvre drive (J, 3G)     Model/3
Jump drive (J, jump-1)      CPU 2
Power plant (J, 3)          Storage 4
Fuel (210 tons -- one jump)
Hold (170 tons)             Fuel purification plant
Hardpoints (three)
> Single turret sandcaster
> Double turret beam laser
=========================== ===========================

=========================== ===========================
Crew and accommodations     Vehicles
=========================== ===========================
Pilot                       Launch (20 tons)
Navigator                   ATV (10 tons)
Engineers (2)               Speeder (6 tons)
Medic
|sp|
1 double stateroom (owner)
7 crew staterooms
3 guest staterooms
2 emergency low berths
=========================== ===========================

*Fuel consumption*. The Distant Star burns 180 tons of fuel for a single jump-3;
it can parcel out fuel for jumps of less distance accordingly, but life-support
costs for the extra time in jump space put constraints on normal space
operation. The ship expends 30 tons per month of operation in normal space.
