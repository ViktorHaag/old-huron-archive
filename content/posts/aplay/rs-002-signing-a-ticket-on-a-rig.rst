Last Friday, Group II of James Maliszewski's *Riphaeus Sector* [RS]_ gang
carried on with the first adventure [RS001]_ where we're all getting used to
each other, how we fit together, and what we might want to be doing within the
Sector. We happily spent less time this session fiddling with A/V issues, but
it's still clear that online gaming might just come with a certain amount of
people having troubles with their audio connection consistently.

Settling on a name
------------------
*Group II* or *A Bunch Of Starport Randos* seemed not useful as a name for the
band of PCs (either in-game or out-of-game, really); the PCs felt
they needed a name they could use to convince the patron that they might,
indeed, be hirable. The group settled on
*Red Planet Investigation & Salvage*.\ [*]_

.. [*] Nicely colourful without being too suggestive of any specific kind of
       job; inspired by salvage consultant `Travis McGee
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_McGee>`_: "We'll help you recover
       your stuff, and take 50% as payment, because half of something is worth
       more than all of nothing."

Meeting the patron
------------------
The patron turned out to be Arlana Jeric, daughter of Jericorp Mining's
founder, and current COO (after the recent, and obviously suspicious, death of
her mother).

She thanked the PCs for their assistance during the sabotage of their leased
sandcrawler (especially for stepping in to prevent further injury to her
father). She added more detail about the history of trials and tribulations
Jericorp had suffered in the years since they'd taken up the lease on the claim
they were currently working (or attmepting to work). Some of these details the
PCs had already learned through some investigation.

Arlana made it clear that Jericorp management was not staffed with fools --
they knew they were being intentionally nobbled, and she strongly suspected
Arash Minerals, but had been to this point unable to find proof sufficient to
get past the corrupt officials in the local government. (Coincidentally, Arash
was working the large claim abutting their own.)

The pitch
---------
Arlana offered the PCs a brief stint as a security and investigation team
attached to the one remaining sandcrawler they had deployed in the desert. The
base rate of pay was modest, but she also offered a sizeable bonus, should they
manage to uncover solid evidence to implicate Arash Minerals, or uncover a
sizeable find within the claim, or both. Arlana had ten days left of burn on
the Jericorp investment here before it was no longer worth pursuing, and she
hoped that getting the PCs to sign on as security for the crawler would help
maximize its chances of striking a lode sufficient to make the leased claim pay
out.

She emphasized that she'd like to get the team deployed out to the sandcrawler
as fast as possible; every hour that past would eat into the ten days of burn
she had left.

Setting out
-----------
The team decided to spend just the time required to get what seemed like a
sensible load-out of "desert worker gear" and some extra weaponry. Arlana had
indicated the group would get ferried out to the crawler by one of the
industrial air-cars that would be attached to the crawler for reconaissance.

It was at this point that the second session drew to a close.
