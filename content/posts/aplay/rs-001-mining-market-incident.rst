Last Friday, Group II of James Maliszewski's *Ripheus Sector* [RS]_ gang
started out on the first adventure of what we hope to be many more. A fair
amount of the session was spent on get-to-know-you kibbitzing and a few
technical glitches, but a reasonable amount of actual play happened, including
an exciting prelude action scene and a solid hook for the next steps in future
sessions.

Backdrop and positioning
------------------------
Play for the Group II characters starts in the `Sanjaa subsector
<https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Riphaeus_Sector/Sanjaa>`_ on the mostly desert
world of Q'Lor, a resource-rich world neatly positioned between two major
polities (not within either) and being exploited by off-shore corporate mining
concerns. It became clear to all of us as James presented the required backdrop
sketch-out that Q'Lor was potentially a flash-point between power-groups on
several levels: the interests of native Q'Lorians versus off-worlders, Sanjaa
Defence League versus Empire of Nagoya, and finally the mining companies that
are both working claims themselves, and leasing out their claims to other
smaller companies (and leasing out equipment to those companies as
well). Rampant rail-baronism at its finest, probably, in other words.

Opening action
--------------
James invited people to suggest how they might have found themselves on Q'Lor,
and where they might be and what they might be doing. I suggested that
my character `Rendan Bardle </posts/rendan-bardle/>`_ might very well have
found himself here using his Administrative and Leadership skills as a
fixer/coordinator of labour for the mining companies, especially within the
realm of "security" -- making use of his military contacts to match skill-sets
with corporate needs on Q'Lor.

Action for Bardle began in a cantina of some sort near the docking bays for the
massive sand-crawlers used to mine materials out of the southern deserts. At
least one other PC was near where the action began: a group of people dressed
in the garb of deep-desert native Q'Lorians hanging around a crawler, armed,
and "hassling" some others. Suddenly another figure popped out of the crawler,
and most of the native Q'Lorians began to run away from the crawler.

The inevitable explosion followed, and then the inevitable plume of smoke began
rising up into the air.

Upon hearing the blast, Bardle immediately looked out a window in the cantina,
and seeing the smoke put down his drank and started running in the direction of
the event.

Other PCs also gave James signals that they, too, would be heading towards the
action.

Responding first
----------------
Without too much surprise, the collection of player characters, most of whom
had not really officially met one another, arrived on scene next to the crawler
before any kind of official security or other first responder personnel from
Q'Lorian governance. Much to my surprise, Bardle seemed to assess immediately
that action needed taking, and he used his seasoned eye to see who among the
new arrivals appeared "capable" (i.e. other PCs all of whom had some degree of
service training), and then immediately tried to take some leadership of those
capable people in opposition to the saboteurs.

Bardle's thoughts immediately were to get the saboteurs to:

- Immediately desist in assaulting the old man they were pummelling with rifle
  butts.

- Surrender at best, or withdraw at worst, without further risk to the health
  of the people around the scene.

To the good side, he had several capable veterans, some of them armed; to the
bad side, only one of them knew him, and had any kind of confidence in his
leadership. Happily, Maj (ex) Wilfred Dargan (the one who knew him) backed him
up *and* was well armed with a sub-machine gun.

The saboteurs broke and started to run, and Bardle was willing to take that as
success. One of the men on his side, understandably, decided it would be a good
idea to capture one of them (the one who looked more in charge) for questioning
and tried to shoot him in the leg. This lead, inevitably, to an escalation and
it might have been an escalation that would have severely wounded some of the
player characters (Bardle guessed). He immediately attempted to fire across
their bow (literally, getting the Major to fire *near* them, but not *at* them)
and bluster their retreat. The saboteurs took the choice and withdrew.

One of the player characters (Athard Robak, Merchant Second Class, ret),
luckily, had a carbine with a scope on it and used the scope to observe the
saboteurs once they were too far away for simple naked-eye observation. He was
able to spy that the saboteurs were not what they seemed when one of them took
off his "deep desert filter mask" to reveal an obviously off-worlder face
underneath.

A new patron?
-------------
After the standoff, the young woman standing by the old man (his daughter?)
approached Bardle to thank him for his assistance, and to suggest that she'd
like to meet him later, more privately. Bardle immediately forecast a potential
opportunity for employment, agreed, and handed her his business card.

Afterthoughts
-------------
James was able to neatly balance the obvious expectations set up by "mining
on a neutrally located desert world, with deep-desert native inhabitants" with
a twisting outcome (the "natives" seem like they're actually off-worlders in
disguise, and potentially members of a rival mining company). This kind of
deployment of inter-textuality and confounded expectations is a simple and
delightful narrative device that most starting adventures and campaigns could
capitalize on.

In retrospect, I think I took more than my share of the mic-time in the first
adventure, but given the situation, the lack of existing player character
organization, and the obvious indication that boot-strapping of some kind to
get everyone moving could benefit from someone stepping up and taking charge, I
spontaneously found that Bardle's character seemed to fit that
situation. Before play, I had kind of envisioned Bardle as a much more relaxed
officer and less interested in leadership, but the character himself seemed to
decide otherwise. A quick scan of the characters stats after the adventure let
me see that Bardle does seem to have the "highest" rank among the PCs, despite
the characters coming from different service branches.

If Bardle's role is to be a leader of this group, so be it; I therefore think
my challenge will be to try to ensure that all the other players get mic-time
in the future sessions, and if Bardle is not leading from behind, he will
certainly attempt to get opinion and contribution from all the PCs before he
might have to make a decision on something.

Traveller is of course *not* a simulation of a military unit, but a game about
a bunch of people who *might once have had* some sort of service
background. Therefore, chain of command isn't naturally in place -- the group
will need to (sooner, rather than later, I would guess) come to some joint
agreement on what decision making structure we'd all like to live with.
