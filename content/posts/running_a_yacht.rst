Noble characters created from the classic _Citizens of the Imperium_ supplement
can muster out with a _yacht_ as a benefit. Unlike the ship benefits from Book
1 (access to a Scout ship, access to a free trader), the yacht that a noble can
end up with does not seem to come with strings attached (no mortgage, for
example; no strong-arming by the Scout service). But just like owning a luxury
car is not as free and easy as it seems, owning a _yacht_ comes with regular
costs that may not seem obvious.

The overhead with running any ship, like most businesses, gets arranged into
several groups of cost. The basic yacht build-out looks like this:

=========================== ===========================
The Garden (Type Y)         200 tons
=========================== ===========================
Manoeuvre drive (A, 1G)     Model/1
Jump drive (A, jump-1)      CPU 2
Power plant (A, 1)          Storage 4
Fuel (50 tons -- two jumps)
Hold (11 tons, plus boats)
Hardpoint
=========================== ===========================

=========================== ===========================
Crew and passengers         Vehicles
=========================== ===========================
Pilot                       Air/raft
Engineer                    Ship's boat
Medic                       ATV
Steward
|sp|
1 double stateroom (owner)
4 crew staterooms
8 passenger staterooms 
=========================== ===========================


Keeping the lights on
=====================
Keeping the yacht in the air needs fuel, maintenance, and a place to park when
you're not in the air.

**Fuel**. Filling the tank on a yacht costs 25,000 credits (refined) or 5,000
credits (unrefined). The yacht can reasonably operate with half a full tank,
because a full tank lets the ship run for two jumps.

* Each jump burns 20 tons of fuel, and approximately one week of time.

* Each week in space burns 2.5 tons of fuel.

**Maintenance**. Only a foolish ship owner puts off ship maintenance. The
annual maintenance cost for a yacht is 51,057 credits, or 981.87 weekly.
Traditionally, ship owners carve off a weekly maintenance fee and bank it in a
fund for the annual maintenance. A subtle point about the annual maintenance:
it takes two weeks, and has to be performed at a class A or B starport (because
they have the appropriate equipment).

**Berthing**. When parked, the ship doesn't have to pay life-support
overhead. Instead, it has to pay for the berthing at a starport: 100 credits
for the first six days, and 100 per day afterwards.

Thus the total mechanical overhead for staying in a port for a week and
refuelling to prepare for the next trip costs about *27,350 credits*.


Keeping passengers alive
========================
The yacht can't fly itself, so people need to do that.

**Crew**. The crew costs for a yacht are not inconsiderable; at minimum, the
ship needs a Pilot and Engineer, and most local authorities require the
presence of a Medic on board with or without passengers. If the yacht carries
passengers, most local authorities require (and passengers certainly expect)
the presence of a steward. Payouts to crew must happen at *least* monthly, but
often more frequently to reduce overhead accounting to a weekly cost. A
minimally talented crew complement (one steward), assuming the ship owner isn't
performing one of those tasks, costs 3,250 credits weekly.

**Life Support**. Life support costs are minimal while berthed, but life out in
space is effectively life sealed in a tin can for weeks at a time. A yacht with
no passengers, but full crew plus the owner in place costs 5,000 credits per
week in space. A yacht with a full passenger complement costs 13,000 credits
per week in space.


Adding it up
============
Adding it up means the weekly costs for a yacht are like this, assuming refined
fuel and fully loaded with passengers:

====================================== ===============
Circumstances                          Effective cost
====================================== ===============
In jump space                          28,500 credits
In normal space                        18,500 credits
In space port                          4,500 credits
====================================== ===============

Note that, in space, each passenger costs 1,000 credits per week (in life
support costs); in space port, passengers are assumed not included.


So, where's the money coming from?
==================================
For yachts, it seems as if there are three potential sources of reasonable
revenue, and one less reasonable.

**Passengers**. High passengers seem like the meat of a yacht's revenue
stream. Each high passenger contributes 10,000 credits a week per jump towards
a destination world, which makes the break-even point for a single jump trip
three passengers. The yacht can accommodate up to eight.

**Mail**. It seems reasonable that mail can be a steady source of revenue for a
yacht. Adding a turret weapon would likely sacrifice one passenger spot for a
gunner crew member, and lose 5 tons of cargo space. The payback for that is
25,000 credits per mail run.

* The cost for the turret weapon is a one-time cost, and if missiles are chosen
  and used, there is a replacement cost for missiles. Lasers can be used within
  the power-plant capacity of the ship and have no consumable cost.

* The cost for a gunner crew-member is 1,000 credits in salary, and the
  incurred life-support overhead, and lost revenue from another occupied
  stateroom in the crew complement.

**Charters**. Chartering price for the yacht probably falls into several
general configurations:

- Mail-yacht (6 tons cargo space, owner plus five crew, seven passengers):
  about 61,500 credits.

- Non-mail yacht (11 tons cargo space, owner plus four crew, eight passengers):
  about 82,000 credits.

**Cargo**. Cargo for a yacht can consume 11 tons (if not fitted out for mail),
or 6 tons (if fitted for mail). Selling cargo space of such small volume seems
like it should target luxury goods or ad-hoc deliveries. Luxury goods probably
need to come with some assurance that the ship can protect them in transit, and
during off-loading.
