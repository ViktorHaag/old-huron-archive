Now that I've held up a thumb in the wind about how I might want to use
*M-Space* circles in my *Traveller* games (with some concrete examples to
support my current campaign), I'm going to follow up with some suggestions on
what the descriptive mechanics for them mean in a *Traveller* context, and some
initial rough working out of how to use them. This post is, accordingly, quite
house-rulesy.

*M-Space* [MS]_ provides a formal way to describe "circles", or groups of people
of various sizes and reaches, organized together for one reason or another,
sharing common goals or beliefs (see MS p156). I decided to borrow this notion
and its approach for my *Classic Traveller* [CT]_ for practical use. In my
borrowing, I decided to call these things "factions" and in a previous post, I
outlined how factions might be described along with some examples for
`factions in the Hounslow system <{{<ref "factions-in-traveller.rst" >}}>`_.

Describing factions
-------------------
As in *M-Space* circles, factions get described with a light set of mecahnics.
Here's a bit more detail on what these mechanics mean, the range of values I'm
using, and so on. Note what I'm going to write here amounts to detail about how
I'm migrating those rules in *Traveller*, not re-writing them; for full use of
these ideas, you probably want to get yourself a copy of the *M-Space* rulebook.

**Type and Descriptor**. Every faction belongs to one of five types:
Organization, Ideology, Corporation, Location, Polity. When writing down the
type of a faction, you also use a *descriptor* that further characterizes it,
for example, "Corporation (Mining Conglomerate)". The first four of these are in
*M-Space*; I liked the idea that a "nation" could also be modeled using
factions, and so I added a "Polity" type to the list. Otherwise, I'm treating
types and descriptors exactly as outlined in *M-Space*.

**Ideas**. I'm using the "ideas" as outlined in *M-Space* (see MS p156-7,166).
I'm not treating their provided list as exhaustive as I don't interpret their
rules to suggest that its list should be. Accordingly, in my examples, I've
added a few ideas that seem at the same general level of scope as the ones on
their list, that more direclty tie to my background:

- *Innovation* -- A notion of progress, especially technical progress is
  important to the faction.

- *Anti-Colonialist* -- The faction is explicitly not in favour of central
  Commonwealth authority and pits itself in opposition to same.

- *Research* -- Gaining more knowledge, especially through science, is a goal in
  itself for the faction.

- *Resistance* -- The faction is in active opposition to some other faction.

- *Pro-Commonwealth* -- The faciton is explicitly in favour of central
  Commonwealth authority.

.. sidebar:: Influence

   Measures the impact a faction can have within the wider society.

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20,80
     :stub-columns: 1

     * - 0
       - No influence. Faction's ideas are unknown to most people in wider
         society.
     * - 1-4
       - Very little influence. Concepts never reach the corridors of power.
     * - 5-9
       - Moderate influence. In favourable circumstances, faction's concepts can
         shape policy in wider society.
     * - A-D
       - Significant influence. Faction's concepts regularly shape policy and
         set the agenda in wider society.
     * - E-F
       - Major influence. Faction's aims and concepts capture the policy and
         agenda of wider society.

**Characteristics**. Every faction has three characteristics given numeric
ratings just as with the properties of characters and worlds in *Traveller*:
INFluence, RESources, and SIZe. The general meanings for these characteristics
is the same as in *M-Space*; howver, the value scales are adapted and specific
to *Traveller*; two of the characteristics range across five groupings (INF and
RES) in *M-Space*, whereas SIZ is more granular..
