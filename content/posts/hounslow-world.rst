Returning to an established setting after a long absence can prove a challenge
for RPG referees. Luckily, the built-in, modular nature of Traveller provides
advantages in this regard. Having already built out parts of Barbican subsector,
I can start fresh while still retaining some context by picking up my focus and
putting it down elsewhere in the subsector and following the old familiar
process of fleshing out a world and its neighbour. In this case a pair of worlds
on the frontier of the sector: the industrial Hounslow and its agricultural
bread-basket neighbour, Becontree.

The starting point for the new player group is more constrained: the player
characters are all retainers of a scion of a noble merchant house, Maria
Josefina Martin y Vargas. Vital to the family's business, Josefina has been sent
out to the far frontier to secure business agreements with concerns there which
will set up a strategic trading pipeline between the frontier and the core of
the commonwealth worlds in `Barbican subsector <{{< ref "barbican-subsector.rst"
>}}>`_. Action will pick up as Josefina and her retainers arrive at the
frontier world where much of the action for the first adventures will take
place: the industrial world Hounslow and its agricultural neighbour Becontree.

This setup allows me to hand-wave away a large portion of Traveller's assumed
natural proposition for players (the economics of small-scale starship
enterprise) so that the player group need not initially be concerned with such
matters. Instead, adventures will focus on the challenges that Josephine faces
as she proceeds to lay the foundation for her family's business interests to
last through the coming decades (using the simple Traveller rule set to resolve
activity).

Starting from this simple premise and the choice of these worlds as the
principal stomping ground for activity, the next step of preparation is fleshing
out the two worlds enough to form the next level of detail as we did with
`Edgware <{{< ref "edgware-world.rst" >}}.>`_.


Hounslow
========
Here's what we know about Hounslow so far from our own sub-sector map and the
*Near Space* [NS]_ original stellar data on the system:

.. code::

   Hounslow     C51097A/9  Sb, In, Na
   HSC0301      BD, Temperate, 010

It's pretty wonderful how compact and suggestive this way of describing worlds
is. Here's how we can describe these numbers:

   **Features**. The system has a Scout base, and an asteroid belt, but no gas
   giants for easy starship refuelling. It has a significant population and has
   viable industry, but no agriculture.

   It has a 'C' class star base, which normally would not be able to provide
   refined ship fuel; however, the presence of the Scout base does mitigate
   this. Some refined fuel is available, but in extremely short (and regulated)
   supply. Likewise, the Scout base presence means that Scouts can have access
   to service data (i.e. navigation and such).

   The main world is a medium sized planet with only a trace atmosphere and no
   water to speak of (just a little bigger than Mars). Despite this, the main
   world is within the star's habitable zone and surface temperatures are
   generally temperate (average temperature between 0 and 30 C).

   Its population is order of magnitude billions of people, but only has between
   one and two billion.

   The government level of 7 means that Hounslow's government is Balkanized; in
   this case, central bureaucracy is weak and loosely organized into a
   confederation of houses and guilds with strong control over their own
   territories. There is a Commonwealth Governor for Hounslow, but the office's
   control over the world's affairs is tenuous and only maintained via a
   constant state of negotiation and multi-lateral agreement secured with the
   ruling authority of each house and guild.

   The law level of 10 (`A`) means that one thing that Hounslow's otherwise weak
   confederation of power scan agree upon is strong prohibitions of weapon
   ownership. Nearly all weapon ownership on Hounslow is strictly regulated and
   criminal possession of same is harshly punished. Visiting traders from
   outside the system are expected to confine any weapons they bring with them
   to their ships and will not be granted landing permits unless they can
   demonstrate that they have secured armouries for containing them.


Hounslow's wider system
-----------------------

The real-world star system for Hounslow is HSC0301, a single-star system with a
real-world spectral type of `BD` according to the *Near Space* [NS]_ book. Brown
dwarfs are not accounted for in the *Scouts* book, but we can just treat brown
dwarfs as just beyond `DM` classifications. Hounslow is in a relatively empty
system; it has only four orbits available, all "outer zone"; two of its orbits
are empty, and it has no captured planets.

===== ================================ ========== ===========

===== ================================ ========== ===========

The system's asteroid belt has a relatively high population (order tens of
thousands), consisting of mining installations directly controlled by a
consortium of independent mining concerns federated under a single cooperative,
and a few representative guild owners based on Hounslow.

**Travel times**. Travel times within the Hounslow system are relatively short,
thanks to the small star and close orbits of the system's features:

* Travel between Hounslow and the belt is about two and a half days at 1G and
  about a day and a half at 2G.

* Travel from Hounslow to a safe jump point is about five hours at 1G and about
  three and a half hours at 2G.

* Travel from the belt to a safe jump distance is about an hour and a half at 1G
  and about an hour at 2G.


Becontree
=========
Here's the basic details for Becontree:

.. code::

   Becontree       E676765/3  Ag, Gg
   Beta Trianguli  A5IV, Temperate, 014*

Becontree, by contrast, is quite different to Hounslow. The narrative
description for Becontree falls out of these numbers like this:

   **Features**. The system has no bases, but it does have four gas giants and
   an asteroid belt. It has a smaller population than Hounslow, but still has
   tens of millions of inhabitants, and has viable agriculture.

   It has an 'E' class star base, barely more than a landing area with no
   facilities to speak of. One of the many ways in which the guilds and
   merchants of Hounslow attempt to preserve Becontree's captive status is
   through a carefully applied dearth of infrastructural investment and the
   quality of the start base is an example of this policy.

   The main world is a medium sized planet with a standard, although slightly
   tainted, atmosphere and 60% water coverage. From the *Near Space* [NS]_ book
   we find the main world is generally temperate.

   Its population is order tens of millions, but only has between ten and twenty
   million inhabitants.

   The government level of 6 means that Becontree has a Captive Government, in
   this case, the confederation of merchant families and guilds of Hounslow
   exert direct control over the governance of the Becontree system. Becontree
   has been partitioned into a number of regions, with each region having a
   Governor that reports directly back to the Hounslow confederate council.

   The law level of 5 puts Becontree a lot more in line with what you might
   think of as a large, agricultural region; personal concealable firearms are
   prohibited, but long arms for hunting and vermin mitigation are controlled
   but not prohibited.

(Note that, unlike the *Near Space* book's data, I used the random procedure to
determine how many gas giants the Becontree system has and arrived at four; the
*Near Space* book specifies only one.)


Becontree's wider system
------------------------

The real-world star system for Becontree is Beta Trianguli, a single-star system
with a real world spectral type of `A5IV` according to the *Near Space* [NS]_ book.

===== ================================ ========== ===========

The system's asteroid belt has a relatively high population (order hundreds of
thousands), consisting of mining installations directly controlled by their
representative guild owners based on Hounslow. Likewise, Annesbury and Ellerton
station (on Ellerton's fourth moon) both have materials research installations
(population thousands) controlled by guild owners on Hounslow.

**Travel times**. Travel times in the busy Becontree system are much more
complicated than Hounslow, but luckily, although there are lots of features
present in the system, habitation is spread rather thin.

* Travel from Becontree to a safe jump point is complicated by the gravity well
  of Woodward, the gas giant around which Becontree orbits. Its about seven days
  at 1G and about five days at 2G. Travel from Ellerton station to a safe jump
  point is about the same.

  Travel from the station on Annesbury to a safe jump point is about six hours at
  1G and about four hours at 2G.

* Travel between Annesbury station to the belt is about four days at 1G and
  about three days at 2G.

* Travel between the belt and Becontree is about five and a half days at 1G, and
  just under four days at 2G.

* Travel between Becontree and Ellerton station is about two weeks at 1G, and
  about nine and a half days at 2G.

While there are plenty of opportunities for raw refuelling, there are no sources of
refined fuel in the Becontree system, and the distances in the outer system,
especially the safe jump system to Becontree itself, make system entry and exit
a gruelling process and not without risk.
