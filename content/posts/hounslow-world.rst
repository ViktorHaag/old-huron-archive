Returning to an established setting after a long absence can prove a challenge
for RPG referees. Luckily, the built-in, modular nature of Traveller provides
advantages in this regard. Having already built out parts of Barbican subsector,
I can start fresh while still retaining some context by picking up my focus and
putting it down elsewhere in the subsector and following the old familiar
process of fleshing out a world and its neighbour. In this case a pair of worlds
on the frontier of the sector: the industrial Hounslow and its agricultural
bread-basket neighbour, Becontree.

The starting point for the new player group is more constrained: the player
characters are all retainers of a scion of a noble merchant house, Maria
Josefina Martin y Vargas. Vital to the family's business, Josefina has been sent
out to the far frontier to secure business agreements with concerns there which
will set up a strategic trading pipeline between the frontier and the core of
the commonwealth worlds in `Barbican subsector <{{< ref "barbican-subsector.rst"
>}}>`_. Action will pick up as Jospehine and her retainers arrive at the
frontier world where much of the action for the first adventures will take
place: the industrial world Hounslow and its agricultural neighbour Becontree.

This setup allows me to hand-wave away a large portion of Traveller's assumed
natural proposition for players (the economics of small-scale starship
enterprise) so that the player group need not initially be concerned with such
matters. Instead, adventures will focus on the challenges that Josephine faces
as she proceeds to lay the foundation for her family's business interests to
last through the coming decades (using the simple Traveller rule set to resolve
activity).

Starting from this simple premise and the choice of these worlds as the
principal stomping ground for activity, the next step of preparation is fleshing
out the two worlds enough to form the next level of detail as we did with
`Edgware <{{< ref "edgware-world.rst" >}}.>`_.


Hounslow
========
Here's what we know about Hounslow so far from our own sub-sector map and the
*Near Space* [NS]_ original stellar data on the system:

.. code::

   Hounslow     C51097A/9  Sb, In, Na
   HSC0301      BD, Temperate, 010

It's pretty wonderful at how commpact and suggestive this way of describing
worlds is. Here's how we can describe these numbers:

   **Features**. The system has a Scout base, and an asteroid belt, but no gas
   giants for easy starship refuelling. It has a significant population and has
   viable industry, but no agriculture.

   It has a 'C' class star base, which normally would not be able to provide
   refined ship fueld; however, the presence of the Scout base does mitigate
   this. Some refined fuel is available, but in extremely short (and regulated)
   supply. Likewise, the Scout base presence means that Scouts can have access
   to service data (i.e. navigation and such).

   The main world is a medium sized planet with only a trace atmosphere and no
   water to speak of (just a little bigger than Mars). Despite this, the main
   world is within the star's habitable zone and surface temperatures are
   generally temperate (average temperature between 0 and 30 C).

   Its population is order of magnitude billions of people, but only has between
   one and two billion.

   The government level of 7 means that Honslow's government is Balkanized; in
   this case, central bureaucracy is weak and loosely organized into a
   confederation of houses and guilds with strong control over their own
   territories. There is a Commonwealth governer for Hounslow, but the office's
   control over the world's affairs is tenuous and only maintained via a
   constant state of negotiation and multi-lateral agreement secured with the
   ruling authority of each house and guild.

   The law level of 10 (`A`) means that one thing that Hounslow's otherwise weak
   confederation of power scan agree upon is strong prohibitions of weapon
   ownership. Nearly all weapon ownership on Hounslow is strictly regulated and
   criminal possession of same is harshly punished. Visiting traders from
   outside the system are expected to confine any weapons they bring with them
   to their ships and will not be granted landing permits unless they can
   demonstrate that they have secured armories for containing them.


Hounslow's wider system
-----------------------

The real-world star system for Hounslow is HSC0301, a single-star system with a
real-world spectral type of `BD` according to the *Near Space* [NS]_ book. Brown
dwarfs are not accounted for in the *Scouts* book, but we can just treat brown
dwarfs as just beyond `DM` classifications. Hounslow is in a relatively empty
system; it has only four orbits available, all "outer zone"; two of its orbits
are empty, and it has no captured planets.

===== ================================ ========== ===========
Hounslow (HSC0301)                                C51097A/9

===== ================================ ========== ===========

The system's asteroid belt has a relatively high population (order thousands),
consisting of mining installations directly controlled by their representative
guild owners based on Hounslow.


Becontree
=========
Here's the basic details for Becontree:

.. code::

   Becontree       E676765/3  Ag, Gg
   Beta Trianguli  A5IV, Temperate, 011
