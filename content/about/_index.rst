   I work in the software industry and spend my non-work time playing tabletop
   role playing and board games and practising Iwama-style aikido. This website
   is an archive of thoughts and projects, mostly related to tabeltop games.

   I've been playing role playing games and board games in earnest for about
   forty years, starting in a high school chess and board game club and
   continuing on through university and afterwards. The first RPGs I owned were
   a *Traveller* set (the little black box) and a *D&D* set (with the
   psychedelic Erol Otus cover).

   **b-side**. I've modified his theme code for this site, but I started with
   Alexander Carlton's excellent `hugo-b-side
   <https://github.com/fisodd/hugo-b-side>`_ theme for the `Hugo
   <https://gohugo.io/>`_ site generator. The site, therefore, indirectly
   borrows from all his influences, as well.

   It leans most heavily on the `tufte-css <https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css>`_
   project with `Optima <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima>`_ as the underlying typeface,
   instead of ETBembo (backed by the `Lato <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato>`_ 
   web font for those without Optima available).
