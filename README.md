This repository contains the code for my website hosted at
https://old-huron-archive.netlify.com/.


I've modified his theme code for this site, but I started with Alexander
Carlton's excellent [hugo-b-side](https://github.com/fisodd/hugo-b-side) theme
for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site generator. The site, therefore,
indirectly borrows from all his influences, as well.

It leans most heavily on the [tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) 
project with [Optima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima) as the
underlying typeface, instead of ETBembo.
